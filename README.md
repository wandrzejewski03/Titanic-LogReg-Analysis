# Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Master Course Assignment)

This project was done as part of a Master's Machine Learning course during my Erasmus exchange in Pavia.  
The base structure of the code was **provided in the course**, and my task was to complete it, adapt it to my case, and prepare a detailed report with analysis.

## Project Description
The goal of the project was to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as:
- Ticket class  
- Gender  
- Age  
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- Number of parents/children aboard  
- Passenger fare  

## Dataset
The dataset is automatically downloaded in the Google Colab notebook using `wget` commands.  
Both training and testing data are taken from Pastebin links prepared for the course.

## Repository Contents
- Google Colab notebook – with the model implementation
- Report – the main deliverable, explaining the steps, analysis, and results  

## Tools Used
- PyTorch  
- Matplotlib

## Notes
This was a master-level course project, while I was a bachelor student.  
The main focus was not just coding, but understanding the method and writing a detailed report.
